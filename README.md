# Network-Hub-Disruption-Probabilities

## Research Description

When designing hub networks, it is important to consider how well these networks are able to function when one or more hubs are disrupted. There is currently a need for efficient algorithms to design transportation networks to account for multiple hub failures. The work presented in this repository is focused on creating data sets reliable hub network optimization algorithms. 

The Reliable Hub Network script assigns selects hub locations, and computes a distance and flow matrix for each hub. Selected hub locations are based on the highest metropolitan areas in the US. Flow data is aggregated from the Freight Analysis Framework version 4 (FAF4), which summarizes the amount of goods transported within and between US metropolitan area as well as other countries. 

Using the designated hub locations, disruption probabilities are assigned based on severe weather event instances. The research focuses on finding both marginal disruption probabilities for each hub, along with joint probability distributions between hubs.
